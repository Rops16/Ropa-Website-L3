            A budget is a plan that helps you manage your money by tracking how
            much you earn, spend, and save. It basically prevents you from going
            broke. The main idea is to list all your expense (what you must pay
            for) and your income (any money that’s coming in) to have a big
            overview of where your money is going. The goal is to ensure your
            expenses aren't more than your income. Tools like budgeting apps or
            spreadsheets can help you stay organized.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Why is it important to budget?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It helps prevent overspending</li>
            <li>
              Help you predict future spending and gain awareness of what is
              truly going on with your money.
            </li>
            <li>Help reach financial goals</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Budgets are the first step in reaching bigger financial goals which
            make it a worthwhile task to draw up one. <br />An easy way to get
            started is to use the famous 50/30/20 rule when managing your money.
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul class="coloured-text">
            <li>50% for needs (rent, food, bills)</li>
            <li>30% for wants (fun stuff)</li>
            <li>20% for savings and debt</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <p>Here are some quick and easy steps to create a simple budget:</p>
          <p>
            Take note of how much money you're making - after taxes - and from
            where. Maybe you have a job, business, investments or just simply
            getting pocket money. Ensure you also note down how frequently
            you're paid.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Take note of all your expenses and how much they each cost and their
            total. Examples of some expenses are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rent / mortgage payments</li>
            <li>Electricity</li>
            <li>Gas</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Food</li>
            <li>Medical Costs</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p class="example-1">Example illustration:</p>
          <img
            src="./graphics/example budget.png"
            alt="example of budget on a spreadsheet."
          />
          <p>
            To make sure you've recorded all your expenses, you can look at your
            bills or bank statements. A bank statement is just a document that
            summarises all your transactions with a bank.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Try to include what the expense is for, how much and when you pay it
            when you record it. This just helps you gain useful insight /
            context on where your money is going explicitly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Set your spending and saving limits. Once you've noted how much
            money you're getting in and how much is going to have to go out
            (expenses). You will have money remaining which can be used for your
            wants and future savings. Wants involve things for entertainment
            such as: eating out , hobbies, luxury items etc. It's important to
            plan on how you want to spend the remainder of your money otherwise
            you'll find yourself not being able to pay for an iced Americano and
            wondering where the rest of your money went.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you're saving - which most should be as it's beneficial- set your
            savings goal. Having some savings can create a safety net for
            unexpected expenses. Even a small amount set aside regularly will
            make a difference.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Saving means setting aside money for future goals (a car, college,
            or emergencies). Spending is about using money wisely for things you
            need and want. Now, these concepts are important as they help build
            financial security, while smart spending prevents debt and stress.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Quick tip: Pay yourself first! Set up automatic transfers to a
            savings account every time you get paid. Even $20 a week adds up
            over time. This links with the 50-30-20 rule in budgeting.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            To balance saving and spending, prioritize needs over wants and
            avoid impulse purchases. Automating your savings can help you stay
            consistent, and tracking your spending can reveal areas where you
            can cut back. This is where a budget can come in and help you.
          </p>

            Note: the above illustration is simillar to how budgeting would be
            tracked. The two tie together in the sense that budgeting can be
            used to track your spending and saving.

            A bank account is where you store your money safely. The most common
            types include checking (for everyday transactions) and savings (for
            growing your money). Having a bank account is a must for everyone
            because it’s used by people and businesses everywhere around the
            world.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Bank accounts help keep your money secure, help you track spending,
            and can even earn your interest. They also allow you to make quick
            and easy payments online and make it easy to view your spending
            history which can come in handy when making your budgets and just
            tracking your spending in general.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some people have multiple bank accounts as they can be used for

          <p>Here are some quick and easy steps to create a simple budget:</p>
          <p>
            Quick tip: Look for accounts with no fees and high-interest rates
            for savings. It's important to know what you're signing up for and
            to understand the terms of your chosen bank. You will find that some
            are better than others in certain areas so it's important to choose
            one that meets you're needs and has terms you're okay with.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Credit allows you to borrow money, like when you use a credit card
            or get a loan. If you handle credit wisely, it helps you build a
            good credit score. Having a good credit score makes it easier to get
            loans, rent a home, or even secure some jobs. Your credit score is
            influenced by paying bills on time, how much debt you have, and how
            long you've been using credit.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            To manage debt effectively, only borrow what you can afford to repay
            and always pay on time. High-interest debts, such as credit card
            debt, can grow very quickly, so it's smart to pay them off first.
            You can tackle debt with strategies like the "debt snowball," which
            involves paying off smaller debts first to build momentum, or the
            "debt avalanche," which targets high-interest debts first to save on
            interest costs. These methods can help keep your debts under
            control.
          </p>
          <p>Some things or general things to remember are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pay bills on time</li>
            <li>Keep credit card balances low (under 30% of your limit).</li>
            <li>
              Avoid unnecessary debt (like buying stuff you can't afford).
            </li>
            <li>
              If you own a credit card, use it responsibly and don't spend more
              than what you can pay back.

        <h1>Investing</h1>
        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Investing is a way to grow your money over time by putting it into
            assets like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Assets are things that
            only bring money into our account.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Things like investments, renting out property (Real Estate) and
            savings accounts. Stocks represent ownership in a company – like the
            Apple or Tesla stocks - while bonds are loans you give to a company
            or government in exchange for interest. Mutual funds are like a
            shared investment pot where many people pool their money together to
            buy a variety of stocks, bonds, and other investments, managed by
            professionals who aim to grow the money for everyone involved.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Investing is highly advantageous, especially at young age, because
            your money is almost guaranteed to grow (not always) over a long
            period of time. This comes from the concept of compound interest.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For example, if you invest $1,000 and earn a 5% return, you’ll have
            $1,050 after one year. The next year, you’ll earn 5% on $1,050, not
            just the original $1,000. Starting early and staying consistent are
            key to building wealth through investing.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            However, investing does have a downside and that is it’s possible to
            lose some or all your money as it’s impossible to accurately guess
            the increase in value of whatever you may have invested in.

        <div class="section-content">
          <p>
            Taxes are compulsory payments made to the government, usually based
            on your income, purchases, or property. Income taxes are the most
            common, and they fund public services like schools, roads, and
            healthcare. Each year, you file a tax return to report your income
            and expenses, which determines how much you owe or if you’ll get a
            refund.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            It’s important to pay taxes on time to avoid penalties and interest.
            Many people use tax software or hire professionals to help them file
            accurately. Keeping records of your income and expenses throughout
            the year makes the process easier.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Filing a tax return is a way to report your income and the taxes
            you’ve paid. In New Zealand, for instance, this involves IRD (Inland
            Revenue Department). Filing might get you a refund if you overpaid
            during the year or may reveal you owe more taxes. You’ll need an IRD
            number (in New Zealand) or similar tax ID in other countries. It’s
            unique to you and used for all tax-related matters.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Not all money is taxed the same way. For instance, money earned from
            a job may be taxed differently from money you make from selling
            items online or investments.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This is not all there is to know about taxes, but it’s worth to note
            as it scratches the surface. Taxes are a part of life and filing
            them accurately and on time is crucial. Good record-keeping and
            planning can help you avoid surprises at tax time.

            Read the fine print! Some loans come with hidden fees, like
            origination fees or prepayment penalties. Make sure you understand
            all terms before signing.
          </p>

          <p>
            The concept of a credit score is important when it comes to
            borrowing. A credit score is like a report card for your financial
            behaviour, but instead of grades, it’s a number—typically ranging
            from 0 to 1,000 or 300 to 850, depending on the country. It shows
            how good you are at borrowing money and paying it back.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A high score means you’re good at managing your money, which makes
              lenders (like banks) more likely to trust you with loans or credit
              cards – essentially trust you to borrow.
            </li>
            <li>
              A low score means you might have struggled to pay back borrowed
              money, and lenders could see you as a risk.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>Your score is influenced by things like:</p>
          <ul class="coloured-text">
            <li>Paying bills on time.</li>
            <li>How much debt you already have.</li>
            <li>How long you’ve been borrowing (your credit history).</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <p>
            It’s a key tool that lenders use to decide if they’ll approve you
            for a loan or credit, and what interest rate they’ll offer.
            Essentially, it’s your “trustworthiness” rating in the financial
            world!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Before borrowing, make sure you can afford the monthly payments and
            understand the terms of the loan. Avoid borrowing for unnecessary
            expenses and always have a plan to pay it back. It’s also important
            to note that different types of loans have specific terms and
            conditions, so make sure the loan fits your needs and repayment
            ability. Ensure to read the fine print! Some loans come with hidden
            fees, like origination fees or prepayment penalties. Make sure you
            understand all terms before signing.

            Borrowing can help you achieve big goals, but it comes with
            responsibility. Only borrow what you can afford to repay and compare
            interest rates to save money.
