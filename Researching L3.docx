Budgeting 

What exactly does a budget do? 

Well, it helps you plan out your spending, so you don’t end up going broke. Pretty straightforward right. By tracking your expenses and following your budget, you ensure the safety of your money, paying bills on time and being able to save for major expenses in an efficient manner.  

Why it’s important:  

They help prevent overspending  

 help you predict future spending and gain awareness of what is truly going on with your money. 

Help reach financial goals 

Budgets are the stepping stone for setting & reaching financial goals. As you can see, they have various benefits that make it worthwhile. 

 

Quick tip: Use the 50/30/20 rule:  

50% for needs (rent, food, bills),  

30% for wants (fun stuff),  

20% for savings and debt. 

 

 

Creating a budget 

Quick & easy steps to creating a simple budget: 

Take note of how much money you’re making – after taxes – and from where. Maybe you have a job, business, investments or just simply getting pocket money. Ensure you also note down how frequently you’re ‘paid’. 

Take note of all your expenses and how much they each cost and their total. Examples of some expenses are: 

Rent / mortgage payments 

Electricity 

Gas 

Water 

Food  

Medical costs 

Insurance 

 

To make sure you've recorded all your expenses, you can look at your bills or bank statements. A bank statement is just a document that summarises all your transactions with a bank. 

Try to include what the expense is for, how much and when you pay it when you record it. This just helps you gain useful insight / context on where your money is going explicitly.  

Set your spending and saving limits. Once you’ve noted how much money you’re getting in and how much is going to have to go out (expenses).  You will have money remaining which can be used for your wants and future savings. Wants involve things for entertainment such as: eating out , hobbies, luxury items etc. It’s important to plan on how you want to spend the remainder of your money otherwise you’ll find yourself not being able to pay for an iced Americano and wondering where the rest of your money went. 

If you’re saving – which most should be as it’s beneficial- set your savings goal. Having some savings can create a safety net for unexpected expenses. Even a small amount set aside regularly will make a difference. 

 

 

In summary, Budgets help: 

Prioritize your needs: ensuring essential expenses are covered first.  

Predict & monitor spending 

Ensure money doesn't run out for expenses 

Helps you gain financial awareness

Saving & Spending 

What it is: Saving means setting aside money for future goals (like a car, college, or emergencies). Spending is about using money wisely for things you need and want. 

Why it’s important: Saving builds financial security, while smart spending prevents debt and stress. 

Quick tip: Pay yourself first! Set up automatic transfers to a savings account every time you get paid. Even $20 a week adds up over time. This links with the 50-30-20 rule with budgeting.

Credit & debt management 

What it is: Credit is borrowing money (like with a credit card or loan) that you promise to pay back.  

Why it’s important: Good credit helps you get loans, rent apartments, and even land jobs. Bad debt can haunt you for years. 

Being able to handle these ensures: 

 Proper management and helps you avoid overwhelming debt, giving you the freedom to make choices like traveling, buying a car, or moving out 

Opportunities: A good credit history can open doors to better loan rates for things like higher education or starting a business. This is why credit cards aren’t always bad. 

Stress Reduction: Knowing you have control over your finances reduces anxiety and allows you to focus on your goals. 

An important concept involved with debt management is interest. Interest is when you often must pay back more than you borrowed. It’s how the bank – in return – makes their money from giving you money. Knowing this can help you make smarter borrowing decisions. 

Good VS Bad Debt 

Debt is what you owe after using credit and it’s not always bad. Good debt allows you to achieve personal goals be it long term or short term. Needing to borrow money to be able to attend college which will lead to the achievement of your target career can be considered good debt. 

Examples: 

Mortgage 

Student loans 

Interest free loans 

Business loans 

Bad debt is purely based on how an individual uses the money they borrowed 

Quick tip:  

Pay bills on time.  

Keep credit card balances low (under 30% of your limit).  

Avoid unnecessary debt (like buying stuff you can’t afford). 

If you own a credit card, use it responsibly and don’t spend more than what you can pay back.

Taxes 

What it is: Taxes are payments you make to the government based on your income, purchases, and property. 

Why it’s important: Taxes fund public services (like schools and roads), and not paying them can lead to penalties. 

Quick tip: If you have a job, learn about W-4 forms (for tax withholding) and file your taxes every year. Use free tools like TurboTax or Cash App Taxes if your income is simple. 

Insurance 

What it is: Insurance is a safety net that helps cover costs when unexpected things happen (like car accidents, health issues, or stolen phones). 

Why it’s important: Without insurance, one accident or illness could wipe out your savings. 

Quick tip: Start with health insurance (if your job or school doesn’t provide it, check out Healthcare.gov). If you drive, car insurance is a must. 

 

Borrowing 

What it is: Borrowing means taking out loans (for school, a car, or a house) that you’ll pay back with interest. 

Why it’s important: Borrowing can help you achieve big goals, but too much debt can trap you. 

Quick tip: Only borrow what you need, and understand the interest rates and repayment terms. For student loans, explore federal options first—they often have lower rates. 

Bank Accounts 

What it is: A bank account is where you store your money safely. Types include checking (for everyday spending) and savings (for growing your money). 

Why it’s important: Bank accounts keep your money secure, help you track spending, and can even earn you interest. 

Quick tip: Look for accounts with no fees and high-interest rates for savings. Online banks like Ally or Chime are great options.
